A guide to implementing AccuRx Video Consultations

In response to COVID-19, AccuRx have released a free video consultation solution for primary care compatible with EMIS and TPP SystmOne. This guide aims to provide some support to practices in implementing the system.

## Sharing changes
This is all provided free on the proviso that if you find bugs or have improvements you share them for the benefit of the NHS. For the geeks please contribute here on github, for the less geeky, if you have something to add please e-mail me at mike@mikedavidsmith.com.

## Installation
The instructions  for installing the software on practice computers is really clearly described on the [AccuRx website](https://www.accurx.com/).

## Using in practice
Two approaches to using video consults are described.

### Protocols
#### Conversion from telephone triage

We have found this the most effective approach to incorperating video consultations. Most patients are happy with a telephone encounter, however sometimes (usually clinically led) video can be helpful to avoid the need for a face to face appointment (e.g. a rash).
#### Reception arranged video consultation

A small number of patients may prefer a full video consult. If your practice wishes to take this approach, this guide describes how to approach that.

#### Editable protocols
These were created using [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net/). An editable version of the above image can be found in the [protocol folder](../master/protocol/).


### Video Guides
There are two separate  videos, one for admin who will be booking the appointment, and one for clinicians who will be offering the appointments.

### Information for practice websites
When patients are sent their consultation details via SMS, they should be sent a link to your practice website that contains a very brief guide and video on how the process will work on their end. Additionally, there is a more detailed guide that patients may wish to read. Both are provided below.
