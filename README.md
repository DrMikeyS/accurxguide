A guide to implementing AccuRx Video Consultations

In response to COVID-19, AccuRx have released a free video consultation soultion for primary care compatible with EMIS and TPP SystmOne. This guide aims to provide some support to practices in implementing the system.

## Sharing changes
This is all provided free on the proviso that if you find bugs or have improvments you share them for the benefit of the NHS. For the geeks please contribute here on github, for the less geeky, if you have something to add please e-mail me at mike@mikedavidsmith.com.

## Installation
The instrucitons for installing the software on practice computers is really clearly described on the [AccuRx website](https://www.accurx.com/).

## Using in practice
The protocol described here is based on reception booking the consult. Other approaches are possible, but we found this to be the most effective.

### Protocol

This was created using [diagrams.net](http://diagrams.net/). An editable version of the above image can be found in the [protocol folder](../master/protocol/).


### Video Guides
There are two seperate videos, one for admin who will be booking the appointment, and one for clinicians who will be offering the appointments.

### Information for practice websites
When patients are sent their consultation details via SMS, they should be sent a link to your practice website that contains a very brief guide and video on how the process will work on their end. Additionally, there is a more detailed guide that patients may wish to read. Both are provided below.
