A guide to implementing AccuRx Video Consultations

In response to COVID-19, AccuRx have released a free video consultation soultion for primary care compatible with EMIS and TPP SystmOne. This guide aims to provide some support to practices in implementing the system.

## Installation
The instrucitons for installing the software on practice computers is really clearly described on the [AccuRx website](https://www.accurx.com/).

## Using in practice
The protocol described here is based on reception booking the consult. Other approaches are possible, but we found this to be the most effective.

### Protocol
