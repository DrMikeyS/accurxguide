Your video appointment has been arranged. All you need to do now is click the link in your text message to be waiting on the video system at your appointment time.

Clicking earlier is OK, although the clinician wonâ€™t join until the appointment time.

*Please be ready for your appointment time.* If you are going to be late, please call reception to let the doctor know.

*The clinician may be running late.* If this is the case, please wait on the line until they are free.

If you would like to try the process ahead of speaking to the clinician, please contact reception and they will be happy to demonstrate the process to you.
